This is cross posting from my msdn which talks about when and how asp.net runtime loads a dll.Please check this [article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rohithrajan/2017/06/29/when-and-how-does-asp-net-runtime-load-dlls/)

I got the need for this post where lot of people are facing issues where some dlls are getting loaded into the process and may be throwing unable to find the dll.

 - [asp.net dll not found for unused dll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44702321/asp-net-dll-not-found-error-for-unused-dll)
 - [ASP.NET - Assembly Not Found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16095432/asp-net-assembly-not-found)
 

I also faced similar issue where a dll not related to my project is trying to get loaded to my application and causing issues.So that rigerred this post.

Hope it helps someone !

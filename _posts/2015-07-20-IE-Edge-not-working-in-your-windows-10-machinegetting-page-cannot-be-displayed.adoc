Are you running into connectivity issue with your IE edge ? Every other browser works but only IE edge is not working!! Even Internet explorer works. It turns out the root cause was very simple for me

##a simple registry change


###make sure you have permission on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList for user "netprofm". if not ,please provide read permissions.


I see that lot of users run into this issue and no one found a solution.See if this setting helps you.
